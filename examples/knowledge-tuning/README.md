# Knowledge Tuning Example

This project demonstrates **knowledge tuning** for AI models using Red Hat technologies. Knowledge tuning enables you to inject domain-specific knowledge into language models, improving their accuracy and relevance for enterprise use cases.

---

## Use Case

Suppose you want to enhance a language model with your organization's proprietary knowledge (e.g., product documentation, internal FAQs) to provide more accurate and context-aware responses.

---

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection**  
    Gather domain-specific documents, FAQs, manuals, or other relevant knowledge sources.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
    Clean, format, and chunk the data for efficient ingestion.

3. **Knowledge Base Creation**  
    Store the processed data in a vector database or knowledge store.

4. **Model Integration**  
    Connect the language model to the knowledge base using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or similar techniques.

5. **Query Handling**  
    When a user asks a question, retrieve relevant knowledge snippets and feed them to the model for context-aware answers.

6. **Evaluation & Iteration**  
    Test the system, gather feedback, and refine the knowledge base and model integration.
